# Heuristics for interaction design

Jakob Nielsen listed [10 general principles][NN/g] for heuristic evaluation. These principles are highly flexible and transposable to many different contexts beyond usability and interaction design.

[NN/g]: https://www.nngroup.com/articles/ten-usability-heuristics/

In short, and as a checklist when needed:

**Meet expectations**

- Match the real world
- Consistency & standards
- Help and documentation

**User is the boss**

- User control & freedom
- Visibility of system status
- Flexibility & efficiency

**Errors**

- Error prevention
- Recognition, not recall
- Error reporting, diagnosis, and recovery

**Keep it simple**

- Aesthetic & minimalist
