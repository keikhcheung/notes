# Learning in public

Learning in public is about the act of sharing progressive knowledge with everyone.

We tend to keep what we learn to ourselves—be it wisdom, talent or insight. It is highly likely that these ideas and learning will wane off over time and may even never come to light. If we intend to keep them alive (i.e. their momentum and vividness) ourselves, it requires effort, motivation and cost (space in our mind, mental cavity). These internalised ideas will become a burden or even pain to us—the *pain of silence*[^1].

Learning in public helps us align with the reality. We may think our ideas and learning are excellent or inferior. These comments might ruminate in our mind and point us to delusional pathways when we continue (or decide not to) on these premises. Making what we think and believe public encourages us to be less radical on our assessment by aligning with reality.

Reasons which we often give ourselves to refrain from releasing our ideas are that these ideas are not yet ready, or it is not the moment to make public. This _later_ easily can turn to _never_. And even when we do release our ideas in the end, they may have grown detached from the reality which has kept evolving concurrently.

The act of learning in public keeps uscloser to reality. When we share openly, we are more likely to not treat ourselves that ‘hard’ on the lessons learnt, but rather in ways akin to how treat a close friend. We moderate any particular experiences[^2].

These benefits of learning in public is similar to how [[Atomic research helps consolidating locked up knowledge in an organisation]] by unlocking siloed knowledge and lightening the cognitive bias from personal interest.

We may be unsure and insecure about making what we think and learn public. This is normal. However, we can transform this from a suppressant into a propellant by embracing our curiosity and reducing the responsibility to anyone who may be interested by our sharing. We shall be responsible for our learning and creative work. The others are free to follow or not.
