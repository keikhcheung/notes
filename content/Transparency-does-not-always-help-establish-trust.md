# Transparency does not always help establish trust

**Accountability** (i.e. clearing out responsibilities) can, to a certain extent, be part of the factors which affect trust bond establishment (but not always). This helps clear out uncertainty and minimise the perception of risk (by rounding the picture favourable for trust leap) (Kahneman; ch. 19).  
--> [[Trust is weaken when beliefs are shaken]]

Exposing legal terms & conditions of service agreement does not really attract attention of the signee. This may be owing to the mismatch of interest, or the inability to digest it.

- Despite consent written in the Terms & Conditions of Facebook, social emotion research on News Feed still stirred uproar of mass users and has been considered as a major trust breach of the century because people trusted in Facebook and its use of algorithms; they had trust in Facebook that it would not treat them in this way as guinea pigs or laboratory rats (Botsman; ch. 4).

**Informed transparency** can help boost trustworthiness and earn (and sustain) trust. But trust is not necessarily given out on the basis of trustworthiness and transparency.

- Mozilla provides information to users on trust leap action points so as to guide them through their informed decision-making. This brings transparency to the user, boost Mozilla's trustworthiness (regardless of their choice on data collection consent), and eventually may help earn their trust (in providing user data).

- Trading on the Dark Web is an example of making use of transparency to make trustworthiness tangible. Through collective review and qualitative experience sharing, people can become informed of trade procedures. Expectation can be set together with trustworthiness (--> [[Trust is different from trustworthiness]]), subsequently translating it into trust leap (--> [[Trust is the basic unit of human connection]]) and deal.

## Question

- Is convenience too often overvalued as advantage?
  - New technology enables trust leap but can also introduce new ‘risky’ behaviour. We do not always know the limit and the far-reaching effects of the powerful technology which we create; nor do we know how to regulate it right away (but rather and only through time and gradual revision loop).
