# Visibility of status empowers user control

[Visibility in system status](https://www.nngroup.com/articles/visibility-system-status/) provides transparent information to the user. This feedback equips them with better knowledge of the situation where they interact with the system and, hence, **empower them to take better action** over the control.  
==> [[Heuristics for interaction design]]

The same heuristic principle can be applied to services. When a customer is provided with the service status and/or the forthcoming service procedure, it reduces the opacity by eliminating the unknowns and unnecessary doubts. As a result, it puts the customer at the centre of control with enabling information, give rise to the service’s reliability, and promotes its trustworthiness.  
==> [[Trust is different from trustworthiness]]

By extension, visibility of status is pertinent to collaborative work. By externalising everyone’s status, it creates an objective pool of knowledge where **every player is better equipped with information** of the status quo and accountability. Thus, they can **produce better decision-making** related to their own capacity and capability to further their contribution.  
==> [[Transparency can but not always help establish trust]]
