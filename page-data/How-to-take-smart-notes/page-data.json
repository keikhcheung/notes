It is similar to the 'verbund' concept in chemistry, where by-products are used as resource elements for another intended production later on (Ahrens; ch. 13). Thanks to the networked connections, you would have a lot more entry points (hence a higher chance) to stumble upon previously associated ideas. You will also be more confident with your ideas as your connected notes make a thought-through trove of supporting arguments (Ahrens; ch. 7).\"), mdx(\"h2\", {\n    \"id\": \"further-reading\"\n  }, \"Further reading\"), mdx(\"ul\", null, mdx(\"li\", {\n    parentName: \"ul\"\n  }, \"Le Cunff, Anne-Laure. \\u2018From note-taking to note-making\\u2019, \", mdx(\"em\", {\n    parentName: \"li\"\n  }, \"Ness Labs\"), \". \", mdx(\"a\", {\n    parentName: \"li\",\n    \"href\": \"https://nesslabs.com/from-note-taking-to-note-making\"\n  }, \"https://nesslabs.com/from-note-taking-to-note-making\"), \".\"), mdx(\"li\", {\n    parentName: \"ul\"\n  }, \"Le Cunff, Anne-Laure. \\u2018The generation effect\\u2019, \", mdx(\"em\", {\n    parentName: \"li\"\n  }, \"Ness Labs\"), \". \", mdx(\"a\", {\n    parentName: \"li\",\n    \"href\": \"https://nesslabs.com/generation-effect-3\"\n  }, \"https://nesslabs.com/generation-effect-3\"), \".\")), mdx(\"p\", null, mdx(\"em\", {\n    parentName: \"p\"\n  }, \"Last update: 2021-02-13\")), mdx(\"hr\", null), mdx(\"h2\", {\n    \"id\": \"references\"\n  }, \"References\"), mdx(\"p\", null, \"Ahrens, S\\xF6nke. \", mdx(\"em\", {\n    parentName: \"p\"\n  }, \"[\", mdx(\"a\", {\n    parentName: \"em\",\n    \"href\": \"How-to-take-smart-notes\",\n    \"title\": \"How To Take Smart Notes\"\n  }, \"How To Take Smart Notes\"), \"]: One Simple Technique to Boost Writing, Learning and Thinking \\u2013 for Students, Academics and Nonfiction Book Writers\"), \".
