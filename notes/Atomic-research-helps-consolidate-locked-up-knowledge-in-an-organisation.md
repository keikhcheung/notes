# Atomic research helps consolidate locked up knowledge in an organisation

Atomic research formats raw data into **reusable, re-discoverable and re-factorable information** for subsequent inductive research. It lengthens the lifetime of research inputs, turn research tangible & concise, and, when successfully implemented, break silos & connect knowledge across departments.

Implementing atomic research requires mostly a centralised research data hub with an **expanding taxonomy**. These are usually tags which mobilise/unlock every piece of raw material and cater it for different ways of eventual exploitation. The outcome of atomic research can be atomic insights—discovered across raw nuggets—and/or succinct reports (e.g. when observed insights are further proven by tests).

A thorough research set-up allows **scalability of research work**. New input / nuggets from various teams can amplify benefits for everyone. Data are unlocked from silos and available across departments, where people from each side can focus on the parts which intrigue them. Research bias (done by first filtering first-hand information) can be reduced through this standardised nugget format, too.
