# Boundaries for a working slip-box system

Keeping the slip-box system effective requires being selective with note-taking and keeping clear boundaries of 3 types of notes.

**Fleeting notes** are just reminders of ideas we came across during the day.
- They are to be processed into permanent notes (if materialisable) or/and then discarded.
- ==> Through the process of turning fleeting notes into permanent notes, we unlock the information/understanding from the source context.

**Project notes** are project-specific, bound to the lifetime of a project, and can be archived/deleted after its end.
- The have lock-in effect. Notes are solely locked to the context to which they apply.

**Permanent notes** are the elaborated ideas per se. They are to be relevant to us–our learning/research at all times.
- They may not be directly pointing to a particular topic (project), but can fill us with thoughts, arguments, discussion or insights; now or later.
- They are linked with other permanent notes and literature notes. This lets us stumble upon them again later, and refer back to sources (fro citation purpose).

**Literature notes** are digest of source reference materials. They gives understanding of the source excerpts and help us cite the references when writing.
- They should be turned into permanent notes if possible so as to become the ‘inspiring sources’ which enriches our own understanding, learning, etc., in an intentionalised manner (e.g. learning/research in the long run).
- Literature notes are stored just for being referenced later. Ideas, arguments/grists, discussions, which these notes should feed or lead to, should be put in permanent notes and interlinked with other existing permanent notes (and project notes, if applicable).

A lean slip-box system is durable and timeless. Maintaining these hygiene factors and boundaries keep our working & thinking environment of learning/research functional as it grows over time.

## Recap / takeaway

- Permanent notes are evergreen by themselves as they are the ideas by themselves, not only reminders thereof (fleeting notes) or applied contextual instances (project notes).
- Permanent notes are appropriated ideas (to our own learning/research interest). They are freed from the source context from which they arrive to us. They are reusable, re-discoverable and re-factorable.

- Permanent notes can be revised and rewritten as their content and our thoughts become stimulated by other findings later.
- Ongoing discussions/corroboration/challenges to and with our permanent notes interweave and enrich our knowledge.
