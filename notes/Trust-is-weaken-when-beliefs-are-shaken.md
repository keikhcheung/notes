# Trust is weaken when beliefs are shaken

**We hold expectation** when we enter in trust bond. We expect the outcome to be realised in the way as how the transaction is prescribed (or promised) on this trust bond.

- Trust is about **encapsulated interest**, closed loop of each party’s self-interests. If we entrust someone to perform a task, we are trusting that they are going to follow it through, because they are also having their self-interest in our common relationship’s longitivtiy (Botsman; ch. 5).

When the outcome does not match with our expectation, people **question the legitimacy** of this transaction; and hence, this trust bond / connection; and further, the integrity of the opposite party.

- Despite consent written in the Terms & Conditions of Facebook, social emotion research on News Feed still stirred uproar of mass users and has been considered as a major trust breach of the century because people trusted in Facebook and its use of algorithms; they had trust in Facebook that it would not treat them in this way as guinea pigs or laboratory rats (Botsman; ch. 4).
- People are losing faith in institutions because we often witness powerful and rich wrong-doers can go away without much repercussions easily. Despite they may be just a few, it strengthens the generalised image to represent their related sectors. Especially these people being the representatives/elites of institutions, they fail the safety net on which we once relied. A case of mistrust can be spilt over to likewise institutions in the same branch. In this way, an occasional, specific case can lead us to a spiralling **trust free fall**, extensible from the top of the society sideways to the society (Botsman; ch. 2).

Accountability (and the deed and manner to bear responsibilities) is crucial in **sustaining trust bond when things go wrong**.

- New institutions (e.g. Uber, Airbnb) are taking the role of _middleman_ between two parties. Compared to traditional companies, their role is ambiguous when incidents happen as the boundaries of responsibility remains unclear (Botsman; ch. 4).
- When AI kills, who bears the responsibility? The code, the coder, or the code owner? The ambiguity is remarkable compared to dogs and dog owners (Botsman; ch. 8).
- [Court case][Uber case] for the first kill by self-driving car has acquitted Uber of responsibility but the driver’s. How much would/can drivers still rely on these vehicles/technology/company?
