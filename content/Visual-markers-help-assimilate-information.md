# Visual markers help assimilate information

Visual markers help reader orientate themselves along textual consumption. They create sediment points which unload ideas as they proceed to process subsequent information, and serve as anchor points which allow them to come back later, if necessary.

Visual markers do not have to be contextually related to the context of information which is being conveyed. They can be as random (e.g. positions in the [method of loci](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Method_of_loci) or mnemonic objects in the [link system](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mnemonic_link_system)) or as trivial (e.g. a drop cap, a yellow dot). The forced association underneath still works even if they are utterly irrelevant.

If visual markers can be contextually related or provide a summary of concept, the mental association will be strengthened. Thus, the information will be retained on stronger bonds.
