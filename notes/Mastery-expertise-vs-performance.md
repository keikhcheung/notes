# Mastery/expertise vs performance

There are differences between *passive* information consumption and *active* retention.

There are also differences between merely reciting facts and skilfully recalling them out & applying them smartly.

Mastery/expertise ≠ good performance of what is taught. To improve on what we do, we should focus on how to aptly mobilise our knowledge, not strictly following instructions.
  - Mastery requires **‘embodied experience’** and flexible application of internalised knowledge (on the right context at the right time.
    - This is only acquirable through prologned, systematic training.
  - In relation to creativity, this ‘mastery’ also works similarly.  
    ==> [[Flexible framework is required for creative work]]
  - **Sticking to rules** (and planning) only makes us good performer/executor according to what is given/planned.
    - To a certain extent, it is a sign of lack of confidence because following a standardised manual provides us a ‘safe’ way to perform to get to a desired, promised result (Ahrens).
    - *‘Example of mastery/expertise vs perfomance on CPR paramedics. Showing the nuance between blindly sticking to rules and planning and flexibly applying internalised knowledge to real-life situations.’* (Ahrens).
    - ==> Recognition, not recall @ [[Heuristics for interaction design]]
